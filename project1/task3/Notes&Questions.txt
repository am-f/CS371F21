Allison: We need to figure out how we're doing public/private classes and methods (making individual attributes private but everything else public? idk). For now I've only put some access modifiers in Block class, I haven't touched it anywhere else
Allison: We should also update our UML diagram with any changes we make
        Marty: So far that includes Block.setLeft() and Block.setRight()
Allison: What do we use offset 0 for? (in freelist)
        Marty: Nothing, it's a reserved value that we return in the case of a failed allocation
Allison: We need to implement iterator before we can do BlockList insert, delete, print, or any of the search methods (right?)
        Marty: I don't necessarily agree? Why do you say that
Allison: I'd like to change String operatingMode to char operatingMode (and just use the first letter of FF, BF, and NF) so we can use = instead of .equals()
        Marty: The string typing was part of the spec we were given, I don't think we have license to change that
